# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description
SVG Logo Maker is an application that creates custom .svg logos according to user specifications. The application code is JavaScript and it runs using the node.js runtime environment. The express.js library is used to request and handle user input to provide details for the custom .svg logo. 

## Installation
The application requires the standard node package manager installation in the root project folder('npm i'), along with express.js('npm install express'). The jest package should also be installed so that all tests function normally.

## Usage 
 Once these are installed, the application can be run from the terminal with the command 'node index'. Once the user provides typed responses to all questions in the terminal, the custom .svg logo is created in the project folder.
